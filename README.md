# CV Master - Module 6 Project - Team7
Weekly project deliveries for the Module C6 based on Video Analysis, from Master's in Computer Vision coordinated by Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB).

- Week 1: the goal is to explore several approaches for background detection, using 2024 NVIDIA AI City Challenge database. The goal is create a model to differentiate between the static background and moving cars.

- Week 2: The goal of this week is to finetune a detection model and perform tracking of the cars of the video sequence s03_c010 from the 2024 NVIDIA AI City Challenge database and evaluate the results using the metrics HOTA and IDF1 from TrackEval.

- Week 3: The goal of this week is to implement optical flow (OF) to the previous weeks detection and tracking algorithm trying to improve the results obtained.
  
- Week 4: The goal of week 4 is to perform a multicamera car tracking algorithm using the techniques learned in any of the previous weeks using any of the video sequences from the 2024 NVIDIA AI City Challenge database.

- Week 5: The goal of this week is to get familiar with the baseline and dataset to perform action classification in football clips.

- Week 6: The goal of this week is to precisely spot the football (ball) actions in time (time instants) without altering the temporal resolution.
